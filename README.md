# [Tesla Wiki](https://adamwett.xyz/tesla-wiki)

There's really no good place to get hard data about Tesla cars. This repository aims to solve that by providing a comprehensive, community-driven resource for Tesla enthusiasts, potential buyers, and researchers.

## Why Tesla?
Tesla's unorthodox manufacturing schedule creates a lot of challenges for consumers and researchers:

1. Frequent updates: Unlike traditional automakers, Tesla often implements changes mid-year or even mid-quarter.
2. Limited official documentation: Tesla doesn't always publish detailed specifications for each update.
3. Regional variations: Features and specifications can vary significantly between markets.
4. Software-defined vehicles: Many features are software-based, leading to rapid changes in functionality.

## Repository Goals
1. Provide accurate, up-to-date information on all Tesla models and variants.
2. Track changes in specifications, features, and pricing over time.
3. Offer a platform for community contributions and fact-checking.
4. Create a reliable source for journalists, researchers, and enthusiasts.

## Content scope
1. Model-specific pages (Model S, 3, X, Y, Cybertruck, etc.)
2. Chronological change logs for each model
3. Feature deep-dives (Autopilot, FSD, Infotainment, etc.)
4. Battery and powertrain specifications
5. Regional differences and market-specific information
6. Pricing history and option packages

## How to Contribute
1. Submit pull requests with new information or corrections
2. Provide sources for all added information
3. Participate in discussions on the Issues page
4. Help maintain and organize the wiki structure

## Data Verification
To ensure accuracy, we will:
1. Require sources for all submitted information
2. Implement a peer-review process for major updates
3. Regularly cross-check information with official Tesla sources
4. Encourage community feedback and corrections

## Future Plans
- Include Tesla's energy products (Solar, Powerwall, etc.)
